- Basis pursuit (rank-2)
- Comparison of tightness of LB at root node to eventual objective, for different parameters (presolve, BP linear equalities, BP Shor equalities)
- For one of the above params, solve to optimality; for others, root node only
- Also compare time taken, memory used
- larger regime
